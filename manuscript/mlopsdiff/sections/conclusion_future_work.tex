%The study was based on data collected from interviewing practitioners involved in developing ML solutions. We focused on companies that had their solutions already deployed which provided unique insights of functioning ML solutions. We interviewed 22 practitioners across 16 organizations (case A-P) involved in the development process irrespective of their role or amount of experience within the team. All the organizations involved are domiciled in Finland although some have global operations. The interviews were semi-structured and based on an interview guide developed prior to the conduct of the study.
