        1 & Can you briefly describe, in a high-level manner, your model deployment procedure? (how do they get models on the edge/cloud server) \\   
        
        2 & What data processing is done for model inference? (Do you perform any parsing or manipulating input data during prediction/inference?) \\
        
        3 & Elaborate in detail the model serving run-time environment, e.g. are you using a custom server, use of containers, use of framework servers (Tensorflow serving) \\
        
        4 & Describe the prediction/inference service, e.g. how is inference served? Batch/realtime/ REST or gRPC-based APIs/in-App Embedded \\
        
        5 & Describe the model update procedure. i.e., where an existing model in production needs to be upgraded, how is model retraining triggered/done post-deployment? \\
        
        6 & Can you describe your deployed model monitoring procedures? e.g. what monitoring metrics are used in production? \\
